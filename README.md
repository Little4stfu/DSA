and guess what i got girlfriend and i wanna be good for her to be a better person so  im staring to learn so that
i can atlease be a better person for her 


And this repo is not  for understanding the topic cuz i  make it  for personal use and  if someone happen to use this repo don't expect detail explanitation of the code try doing research  yourself

And Tips:
1.Try building  logic on pen paper before doing actual code //best  advice
2.Even if u watch tutorial try to dryrun the program by  yourself using  ur mind
